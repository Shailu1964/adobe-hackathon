## About the Project
This project is part of the Adobe Hackathon Challenge 1B. It provides a robust, containerized pipeline to process PDF documents, extract sections, and perform semantic analysis using transformer-based NLP models (`sentence-transformers`).

## Features
- Batch processing of PDF files
- Sentence/section embedding using transformer models (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Semantic ranking and clustering of document sections
- Output results as JSON for downstream analysis
- Fully containerized for reproducibility and easy onboarding

## Quickstart (TL;DR)
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd adobe-hackathon/challenge-1b
# Place your PDFs in input/
docker-compose up --build
# Results will appear in output/
```

---

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd adobe-hackathon/challenge-1b
```

### 2. Prepare Input Files
- Place **all PDF files** you want to process into the `input/` directory.
- Example:
  ```bash
  cp /path/to/your/*.pdf input/
  ```

### 3. (Optional) Download Models
- If you want to pre-download the transformer model (for offline use), run:
  ```bash
  python downloa_models.py
  ```
- This will save the model in `models/`.

### 4. Build & Run with Docker Compose
- Build and start the pipeline:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
- Output will be written to `output/`.

### 5. (Alternative) Run Locally Without Docker
- Ensure Python 3.10+ and pip are installed.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the main script:
  ```bash
  python src/main_1b.py
  ```

## Usage Instructions

### Using Docker Compose
1. **Add PDFs:** Place your PDF files in the `input/` folder.
2. **Run:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. **View Output:**
   - Processed results will appear in the `output/` directory as JSON files.
   - Logs are visible in the console and in `/tmp/process.log` inside the container.

### Manual Python Run
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run:**
   ```bash
   python src/main_1b.py
   ```
3. **Output:**
   - Results in `output/`

---

## Docker & Docker Compose
- **Dockerfile:** Defines the environment, installs Python and system dependencies, copies code, and sets up the entrypoint.
- **docker-compose.yml:** Mounts `input/` and `output/` as volumes, so files persist on your host.

### Common Docker Commands
- Build & run:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
- Stop containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
- View logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Permission Errors:**
  - If you see permission errors with `input/` or `output/`, ensure you are running as root in Docker (default for this repo).
  - On Windows, avoid using a non-root user in Docker due to volume permission issues.
- **No Output:**
  - Check that your PDFs are in `input/` before starting the container.
  - Check logs for errors (`/tmp/process.log` inside the container).
- **Model Download Issues:**
  - Ensure internet access for downloading models, or pre-download using `downloa_models.py`.
- **Docker Compose Version Warning:**
  - If you see a warning about the `version` attribute, you can safely ignore or remove it from `docker-compose.yml`.
