# Methodology and Approach for Challenge 1A & 1B

## Challenge 1A: Universal Document Outline Extraction

### Objective
The goal of Challenge 1A is to automatically extract a universal, hierarchical outline from a diverse set of PDF documents. This outline serves as a structured representation of the document's content, enabling easier navigation, summarization, and downstream analysis.

### Methodology
1. **Preprocessing and Input Handling:**
   - The pipeline begins by ingesting PDF files placed in the `input/` directory.
   - Each PDF is parsed using robust PDF handling libraries to ensure compatibility with a wide range of document layouts and encodings.

2. **Outline Extraction:**
   - The system first attempts to extract the Table of Contents (TOC) directly from the PDF metadata if available.
   - If no valid TOC is found, a custom heuristic-based approach is employed. This involves:
     - Detecting section headers using regex patterns for numbering, capitalization, and font size/style cues.
     - Inferring hierarchical relationships (e.g., chapters, sections, subsections) based on indentation, numbering schemes, and formatting.
   - The result is a tree-structured outline capturing the document's logical flow.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The extracted outline is serialized as a JSON file in the `output/` directory, preserving the hierarchy and section metadata for each processed document.

### Key Techniques and Libraries
- **PDF Parsing:** Libraries such as PyPDF2 or pdfminer.six for robust PDF text extraction.
- **Heuristic Analysis:** Custom regex and logic for section detection and hierarchy inference.
- **Containerization:** Docker is used to encapsulate the environment, ensuring reproducibility and ease of deployment.

## Challenge 1B: Semantic Section Understanding with Transformers

### Objective
Challenge 1B extends the pipeline by not only extracting sections but also performing semantic analysis using advanced NLP models. The aim is to generate meaningful embeddings for each section, enabling tasks like semantic search, clustering, and ranking.

### Methodology
1. **Batch PDF Processing:**
   - PDF files are batch-processed from the `input/` directory, with each document being parsed and segmented into logical sections.

2. **Sentence/Section Embedding:**
   - Each section is passed through a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to generate high-dimensional semantic embeddings.
   - These embeddings capture the contextual meaning of sections, enabling similarity comparisons and downstream analytics.

3. **Semantic Ranking and Clustering:**
   - Sections can be ranked by semantic similarity to a query or clustered to identify related topics within or across documents.
   - This leverages vector space operations (e.g., cosine similarity) on the embeddings.

4. **Output and Reproducibility:**
   - Results, including embeddings and rankings, are output as JSON files in the `output/` directory.
   - The entire process is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy setup and reproducibility.

### Key Techniques and Libraries
- **NLP Models:** `sentence-transformers` library with transformer models for embedding generation.
- **PDF Handling:** Similar PDF parsing stack as 1A.
- **Clustering/Ranking:** Standard vector operations and clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering) where applicable.
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose for environment management.

## Summary
Both solutions are designed for robustness, scalability, and ease of use. Challenge 1A focuses on structural understanding, while Challenge 1B adds deep semantic analysis. The use of containerization ensures that the solutions are portable and reproducible across different environments. The modular design allows for easy extension and integration with other document processing or analytics pipelines.
